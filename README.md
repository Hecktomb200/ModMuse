# ModMuse
ModMuse is an AI-powered recommendation system that helps gamers discover new ways to enjoy their favorite titles. By entering a simple prompt — such as “I want a hardcore survival experience in Skyrim” — ModMuse intelligently generates a curated list of compatible mods that deliver that experience.

The system uses AI to parse the player’s intent, cross-references a database of known mods (including categories, tags, and compatibility data), and returns a structured recommendation set. Long term, ModMuse aims to support multiple games and allow the community to contribute new mod metadata.
